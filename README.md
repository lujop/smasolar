Library with interfaces to some sma devices.
This is a personal project to interactuate with some SMA devices that I've at home.

This project is absolutely unofficial and neither the author nor the application has any relationship with SMA Solar.

The initial scope of the project is to have interface to operate with:
- Read energy meter lectures using Energy meter protocol
- Read values from Sunny Boy inverter and Sunny Boy Storage using modbus
